## Analysis
### Key Findings
- Significant progress has been made in quantum computing in recent years, with companies like Google, IBM, and Honeywell building increasingly powerful quantum computers
- In 2019, Google claimed to achieve "quantum supremacy" with a 53-qubit processor called Sycamore that solved a problem in 200 seconds that would take a classical supercomputer 10,000 years [^1]
- Current quantum computers are still prone to errors and not yet practical for most applications, but the technology is rapidly advancing [^2]
- Quantum computers pose a major threat to current cryptographic systems, as they can theoretically break many widely-used encryption algorithms like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) [^3]
- NIST estimates that a quantum computer capable of breaking 2048-bit RSA encryption could be built by 2030 [^4]

### Emerging Trends 
- Tech giants and governments are heavily investing in quantum computing R&D
- Focus is shifting from proving quantum supremacy to developing practical, fault-tolerant quantum computers [^1]
- Increasing interest in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to develop quantum-resistant encryption methods
- NIST is currently leading a standardization process for PQC algorithms, with the goal of selecting a new suite of cryptographic standards by 2024 [^4]

### Technical Implications
- Many current public-key cryptographic algorithms used for secure communication, digital signatures, etc. will become vulnerable to quantum attacks
- Symmetric key algorithms like AES are less impacted but will require doubled key sizes (e.g. from 128-bit to 256-bit) [^3]  
- Migration to post-quantum algorithms will require significant effort to upgrade protocols, software, and hardware
- Challenges include algorithm efficiency, compatibility with existing systems, and ensuring trust in new standards

### Business Impact
- Sectors that rely heavily on cryptography, such as finance, healthcare, government, and critical infrastructure face the greatest risks
- Stolen encrypted data could be stored now and decrypted once quantum computers become available, known as "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks [^5]
- Opportunities for quantum computing in optimization, machine learning, drug discovery, and more could drive major industry disruptions
- Potential for major security breaches and loss of sensitive data if quantum-vulnerable systems are not upgraded in time

### Future Outlook
- Rapid advancement of quantum computing makes it difficult to predict exact timelines, but estimates range from 5-20 years before cryptographically relevant quantum computers exist [^4]
- Hybrid quantum/classical algorithms and quantum-inspired approaches on classical hardware may provide some benefits in the nearer-term 
- Geopolitical tensions could accelerate quantum computing development as nations vie for technological supremacy
- Ongoing research into quantum-safe cryptographic solutions and standards will be critical to ensuring a smooth transition

### Recommendations
- Organizations should assess their cryptographic dependencies and develop quantum risk management strategies
- Begin testing and implementing post-quantum cryptography in phases, prioritizing high-value assets and data with long-term sensitivity
- Adopt crypto-agility best practices to enable rapid switching of algorithms and key sizes as standards evolve
- Invest in quantum literacy for technical staff and decision-makers 
- Monitor NIST's PQC standardization process and plan to adopt final selections
- Consider potential opportunities enabled by quantum computing in addition to focusing on risk mitigation
